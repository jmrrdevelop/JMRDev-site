# JMR Dev - Privacy Policy

Last updated: 24 December 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how **JMR Dev** ("we", "us") handles information on our developer website and through the mobile applications that we publish.

## 1. Who we are

JMR Dev is an independent software developer creating mobile applications, including (but not limited to) Horse Notify and future apps published under the JMR Dev developer account on Google Play.

If a specific app has its own privacy policy, that policy will apply in addition to this one and will provide more detailed information about how that app processes data.

## 2. Information collected on this website

This website is hosted on GitHub Pages and is intended only as an informational site for our apps.

- We do not actively collect personal data (such as contact forms or user accounts) on this site.
- Standard technical information may be collected automatically by your browser and the hosting platform (for example, IP address, browser type, operating system, referring URL). This is used only for basic security and performance purposes. [GitHub Pages documentation]

We do not use this website to track users for advertising purposes.

## 3. Information collected by our apps

Our mobile applications may collect personal data as needed to provide their features (for example, account details, messages, or analytics). The exact types of data and purposes are described in the **individual privacy policy for each app**.

You can find the privacy policy for each app in its store listing on Google Play and, where applicable, inside the app itself.

## 4. Legal basis and purposes

We process data only when necessary to:

- Provide and operate our apps and services
- Maintain the security and stability of our systems
- Comply with legal obligations that apply to us

Where required by law, we will obtain your consent before processing personal data for specific purposes.

## 5. Data sharing

We may share data with:

- Service providers that host our infrastructure, store data or provide analytics
- Authorities when required by law or to protect our rights and users

These parties are required to protect the data and use it only for the purposes described above.

We do not sell personal data.

## 6. Data retention

Data is kept only for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Policy or in the privacy policy of each app, and then deleted or anonymised.

Retention periods may differ between apps depending on their functionality and legal requirements.

## 7. Your rights

Depending on your location and applicable law, you may have the right to:

- Access the personal data we hold about you
- Request correction or deletion of your data
- Object to or restrict certain types of processing
- Request a copy of your data in a portable format

To exercise your rights for a specific app, please follow the instructions in that app’s privacy policy or contact us using the details below.

## 8. Security

We take reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect personal data against unauthorised access, loss, misuse or alteration.

No system can be completely secure, so you should also take care to protect your devices and accounts.
